    All WebHare assets that usually do not require authentication (ie they are well-known, only content-addressable or do their own authentication)
    must be moved to `/.wh/` so we have a single path to exclude from login checks.

    All under `/.wh/dev/` will be assigned to the standard 'dev' module (mod::dev/web/wh-dev/)
     `/.wh/common/` is a common location for tools such as Publisher feedback pages. It is managed by the 'platform' module
