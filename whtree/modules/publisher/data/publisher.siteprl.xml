  <!-- ======================================================================

       Make sure we can ALWAYS change site root folders back to "normalfolder"
       We need this because it's easy to accidentally block switching back if you do this:

       <apply
         <to type="all" parenttype="http://www.example.net/xmlns/footerfolder" />
         <denyfoldertype typedef="*" />
         <allowfoldertype typedef="http://www.example.net/xmlns/footersection" />
       </apply>

       which seems like a good idea, but because a site root folder tests parenttype= on *itself*
       changing a root folder's type becomes irreversible. The following rule fixes it
