# Search engine optimalization

You can control the meta robots tag rendered by WebHare by setting the webdesign's
`robotstag` property. The robot properties can only be updated in the preparation phase
of a template.

## Legacy search data
The consilio `<robots xmlns="http://www.webhare.net/xmlns/consilio" />` has been deprecated
and is no longer needed to add a meta-robots tag.
