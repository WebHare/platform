  <!-- newdocflow is not an officially supported flow yet, it was an experiment to see if a flow: 'create file first, only save to target folder on first Save'
       could work. however, this is now broken because Save on a new file doesn't setup a final version anymore, just another draft. Which makes it even harder
       to find the object. Plus, it turns out name/title/descrption isn't saved properly to a draft anyway, even if the file itself is already published and that
       this must have always been broken since the new metatabs appeared

       As you can't reach this flow through the UI anyway, xfail it until we get around to at least fixing the name/title/description issue and then
       reconsider whether we want the newdocflow -->
