# 4.12
## Incompatible changes
- Applications must explicitly optin to receiving URL parameters (eg 'params' in Init()) from non-sysops by adding `allowuntrustedparams="true"` to their `<application>` node. Servers in development mode are not affected
- Webpack is now a substitute module - new installation will not automatically have webpack enabled.
