# 4.28 - current master

## Incompatibilities and deprecations
- `@mod-system/js/compat/innertext.js` is obsolete and has been removed. See https://gitlab.com/webhare/platform/issues/7
- The implementations `widgetedit` (`<screen implementation="p:widgetedit">` and `WidgetEditScreenBase`) and `widgetextension`
  (`<tabsextension implementation="p:widgetextension">` and `WidgetEditExtensionBase`) have been deprecated since March 2019 and have now been removed.
    A widgetedit screen should be replaced with a tabsextension (see https://forum.webhare.dev/t/editing-widgets-editfragment-editscreen-and-editcomponent-deprecated/33)
    and for a widget tabsextension the implementation attribute can be removed.
- The `datastore` property for `<p:whfsinstance>` has been removed.
- `wh rewrite` is now `wh dev:rewrite`
- Assigning `DEFAULT RECORD` to a composition no longer resets all associated cells, as this was inconsistent with the behavior of
  assigning partially set records (which ignored instead of cleared missing cells). Use `ResetValue` to explicitly reset all cells of a composition
- formsapi forms that want to resubmit themselves without invoking `reset()` on themselves first, must invoke `reallowSubmission()` (eg in onSubmitSuccess)
  to prevent accidental submission loops.
- Support for storing siteprofiles in the Publisher has been removed. All siteprofiles should now be in modules and loaded through `<webdesign>` and/or `<webfeature>`s
- %GenerateBrowserScreenshot now always returns the screenshot in a `screenshot` cell of the return value
- %GenerateBrowserScreenshot no longer accepts a `strategy` parameter in the `cutouts` option
- `rpc.json` services no longer enforce one call at a time. If you need to enforce this you'll have to manage and await promises yourself.
- `rpc.json`'s `rpcResolve` has been deprecated. Use `AbortController`s for 4.28+ code. A IE11 polyfill has been added
- `@mod-system/js/net/jsonrpc` has been deprecated.

## Things that are nice to know
- WRD types now have a `haspersonaldata` flag, which can be set to TRUE for types that may contain sensitive user data. All types that refer to a type that has set `haspersonaldata` to TRUE are also considered to contain user data. The `WRD_PERSON` type has this flag set by default. When exporting or syncing WRD schemas you can choose to only export/sync non-personal data, all data or select which types to export/sync. Exporting and syncing WRD schemas now also logs audit events.
- Tollium now has support for custom implementations and component parsers. See [Custom implementations and component parsers](topic:tollium-components/parsing) for more information and examples.
- `GeneratePDF` now supports setting the page margins and headers and footers
- The new 'Feedback' app allows you to gather reports from WebHare backend users
- You can now hide webdesigns/webfeatures completely if they are deprecated or test-only by setting the `hidden` flag in XML
- Users with readonly access can now create archives in the Publisher (but probably only download them)
- `wh publisher:findwidgets` helps you find and republish users of widgets
- A new RPCClient has been created to replace `@mod-system/js/net/jsonrpc`. See https://www.webhare.dev/reference/rpc/services for the new syntax
  and a migration guide
- A `<filetype>` can now set `kind=virtualfile|rawfile|datafile` to quickly set some of the most common fileype properties
- A `<filetype>` or `<foldertype>` can now define members in its `<members>` subproperty
- Contenttype members can now use their type as localname: eg `<member name="mytext" type="string" />` can now just be `<string name="mytext" />`
