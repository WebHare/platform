## Incompatibilities and deprecations

## Things that are nice to know
- WRD types now have a `haspersonaldata` flag, which can be set to TRUE for types that may contain sensitive user data. All types that refer to a type that has set `haspersonaldata` to TRUE are also considered to contain user data. The `WRD_PERSON` has this flag set by default. When exporting or syncing WRD schemas, you can choose to only export/sync non-personal data, all data or select which types to export/sync. Exporting and syncing WRD schemas now also log audit events.
