# 4.28 - current master

## Incompatibilities and deprecations
- `@mod-system/js/compat/innertext.js` is obsolete and has been removed. See https://gitlab.com/webhare/platform/issues/7
- The implementations `widgetedit` (`<screen implementation="p:widgetedit">` and `WidgetEditScreenBase`) and `widgetextension`
  (`<tabsextension implementation="p:widgetextension">` and `WidgetEditExtensionBase`) have been deprecated since March 2019 and have now been removed.
    A widgetedit screen should be replaced with a tabsextension (see https://forum.webhare.dev/t/editing-widgets-editfragment-editscreen-and-editcomponent-deprecated/33)
    and for a widget tabsextension the implementation attribute can be removed.
- The `datastore` property for `<p:whfsinstance>` has been removed.
- `wh rewrite` is now `wh dev:rewrite`

## Things that are nice to know
- WRD types now have a `haspersonaldata` flag, which can be set to TRUE for types that may contain sensitive user data. All types that refer to a type that has set `haspersonaldata` to TRUE are also considered to contain user data. The `WRD_PERSON` type has this flag set by default. When exporting or syncing WRD schemas you can choose to only export/sync non-personal data, all data or select which types to export/sync. Exporting and syncing WRD schemas now also logs audit events.
- Tollium now has support for custom implementations and component parsers. See [Custom implementations and component parsers](topic:tollium-components/parsing) for more information and examples.
