# 4.28 - current master

## Incompatibilities and deprecations
- `WebdesignBase::GetcachableSiteconfig` has been removed, use `WebdesignBase::GetCacheableSiteConfig`
- It's no longer accepted to specify a `<webdesign objectname=>` without a `library=` (unless the objectname is a (relative) path, ie it contains a `#`)
- Usersmanagement no longer allows users in the root unit. This has the following consequences:
  - The `WHUSER_UNIT` in the system usermgmt schema site now required.
  - The testramework will not setup a userapi for the testschema unless `wrdauth := TRUE` is explicitly set as a test option.
  - `wrdauth := TRUE` is automatically set if the test created testusers or testroles.
  - You'll need to pass a `WHUSER_UNIT` in tests if wrdauth is enabled for the test schema. Use `testfw->testunit` (testunit will be backported to 4.26)
  - Any users, units and roles in deleted units will be moved to an automatically created "Lost & found" unit.
- `runmodel`, deprecated since 4.03, has finally been removed

## Things that are nice to know
- Adds `wh rewrite` which reformats XML files (and does some automatic conversions, such as `editfragment=` to `editextension=`)
- HS error pages now have links leading you directly towards the proper editor location (assuming you have dev-agent properly set up)
