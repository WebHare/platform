# 4.28 - current master

## Incompatibilities and deprecations
- `WebdesignBase::GetcachableSiteconfig` has been removed, use `WebdesignBase::GetCacheableSiteConfig`

## Things that are nice to know
- Adds `wh rewrite` which reformats XML files (and does some automatic conversions, such as `editfragment=` to `editextension=`)
- HS error pages now have links leading you directly towards the proper editor location (assuming you have dev-agent properly set up)

## Things you should do
