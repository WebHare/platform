# 4.28 - current master

## Incompatibilities and deprecations
- `@mod-system/js/compat/innertext.js` is obsolete and has been removed. See https://gitlab.com/webhare/platform/issues/7

## Things that are nice to know
- WRD types now have a `haspersonaldata` flag, which can be set to TRUE for types that may contain sensitive user data. All types that refer to a type that has set `haspersonaldata` to TRUE are also considered to contain user data. The `WRD_PERSON` type has this flag set by default. When exporting or syncing WRD schemas you can choose to only export/sync non-personal data, all data or select which types to export/sync. Exporting and syncing WRD schemas now also logs audit events.
