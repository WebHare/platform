# 4.26 - 2019-09-25

## Incompatibilities and deprecations
- Support for HTML posts in the formsapi has been removed. All formsapi forms must submit through XHR
- Support for native HTML5 validation has been deprecated and will no longer be tested. All formsapi forms should move to standard validation
- We are considering deprecating and removing prebuilt file types. Avoid using them in new projects and use %ConvertPrebuiltFiles to clean up
  existing instances at some point.
- mod::system/lib/addons/geoip.whlib has been removed - see mod::publisher/lib/analytics.whlib for GeoIP APIs.

## Things that are nice to know
- The new Tollium component `<url>` allows a disabled copy-pasteable view of a URL, with explicit Copy and QR Code buttons
- You can now disable wordwrap on Tollium `<textarea>`s. Useful for eg. DNS configuration data which should not wrap
- Tollium `<textarea>`s without an explicit `width=` will now suggest to be 30 instead of 2characters wide, just like `<textedit>`,
  fixing dialogs with only a textarea from getting very small
- Tollium `<image>` now supports [objectfit](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit).
- %GenerateXLSXFile wraps XLSX generation in a format compatible with %RunColumnFileExportDialog
- WebHare will now ensure that `/webhare-private/<modulename>/` exists for every module.
- You can now 'login as' a role in WebHare's user management
- `webdesign->structuredbreadcumb` contains auto-generated breadcrumb data
- If `webdesign->structuredbreadcumb` is set, we will automatically include it as structured LD+JSON metadata

## Things you should do
- Use %OpenWHFSPrivateFolder to find `/webhare-private/<your module>/` (and never hardcode object id `10`), and stop
  using `EnsureFolder` to create this toplevel folder to reduce race conditions during module activation.
- If you've added your own schema.org BreadCrumb data, you may want to suppress the 4.26 generated breadcrumbs.
  See https://forum.webhare.dev/t/4-26-will-introduce-automatically-generated-breadcrumbs/59
- `CreateSubField` is a cleaner way to create form subfields as compared to `AppendFormField` which turned out to be
  error-prone and did not fully support array subfields.
  Replace the pattern `this->form->AppendFormField(this, "textedit", this->name || ".sub")` with `this->CreateSubField("textedit", "sub")`
