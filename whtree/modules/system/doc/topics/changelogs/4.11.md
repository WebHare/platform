# 4.11
## Incompatible changes
- `GetCallingLibrary` is removed as a public symbol. Use `Resolve()` instead.
- `<datetime>` fields of type `date` no longer accept `storeutc`, i.e. they will always return a `DATETIME` value with the selected date and time 0:00 and setting a `DATETIME` value will only set the date, ignoring the time. On development, test and acceptance servers, setting or getting the value of a `<datetime type="date" storeutc="true">` component will throw an exception.
- forms.whlib now rejects updates to disabled fields, just like normal HTML5 forms. You can set up a whitelist regex to allow
  certain disabled fields to be overwritten or even get the old behaviour back by setting `this->formsubmitdisabledregex := ".*";`
  in your form's NEW(), but you need to guard against users trying to modify the disabled values.
