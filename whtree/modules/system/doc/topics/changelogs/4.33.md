# 4.33 - Current master

## Incompatibilities and deprecations
- The WebHare backend no longer supports Internet Explorer, including IE11. So long, and thanks for all the (Active)X.
- The WebHare backend is now protected by a Content-Security-Policy on development installations (in preparation for
  enabling this everywhere)

## Things that are nice to know
- Adds an experimental and much faster esbuild based build pipeline. Optin by setting any of the `es2016`..`es2021` or `esnext`
  values as your assetpacks 'compatibility' value. (4.32 will still compile these as 'modern', but 4.31 will not support this
  property at all).
  - Keep in mind that esbuild does not properly support `url()` in SCSS @imports done from other SCSS files (it resolves them
    relative to the highest level SCSS entrypoint). Moving the SCSS @import statement to a JS import often fixes this.
  - esbuild is *much* stricter than the original webpack setup we provided and has no way to transpile your code back to IE11 compatible code
  - For testing, you can force *all* assetpack builds to use esbuild instead of webpack by starting WebHare as follows:
    `WEBHARE_ASSETPACK_FORCE_COMPATIBILITY=es2018 wh console`. (future versions may remove this option)
