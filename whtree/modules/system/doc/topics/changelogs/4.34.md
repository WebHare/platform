# 4.34 - Current master

## Incompatibilities and deprecations
- WebHare no longer runs install scripts for npm modules downloaded by fixmodules.
- The WebHare V2 Witty APIs (deprecated since V3) have been removed.
- The undocumented `[repeat]` witty statement has been removed.
- Lists now prefer the colored versions everywhere (icon*s* columns used to prefer the black version where other list icons preferred the color version)
- Modules can no longer be deployed to remote servers from the system:config application - this functionality has moved to the dev module
- Users no longer have implicit browse rights on their parent unit in user management
- Removes support for the old siteprofile `<consilio:index>`, `<consilio:addtoindex>` and `<consilio:contentsource>` syntax.
- `striprtdextension` is now set by default to start a phase-out for the `.rtd` extensions for new files
- `->ScheduleTask` (deprecated since 4.27) will now fail on non-production installations. Replace with %ScheduleManagedTask.
- The `dompack:scrollintoview` event has been removed. You should replace calls to `dompack.scrollIntoView(node,...)` with a
  call to `node.scrollIntoView` and use CSS [scroll-margin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-margin)
  to solve sticky header covering issues.

## Things that are nice to know
- The dialogapi's keyboard capture has been improved to not capture ALL keyboard events (including eg reload) just to prevent
  you from moving focus outside the dialog
- A new Tollium element `<statuspanel>` has been added to wrap showing an info/warning/error at the top of a screen or panel.
- Title field 'seo title' and 'header title' have been added. See [seo-settings.md](https://www.webhare.dev/reference/siteprofiles/seo-settings)
- RunSimpleScreen now supports a `html` option allowing you to pass rich text to dialogs
- Assetpacks no longer create separate `.dev` versions for development. Instead you can enable/disable development mode for assetpacks in the dashboard
- You can configure an external ClamAV virus scanner to scan incoming uploads
- The domain contents used by `GetDomValTitle` etc are now cached in the adhoc-cache (if the attribute's domain is actually of a Domain type)
- Adds `wh debug mark [text]` allowing you to insert a marker text into the log files
- %FormatISO8601Datetime now accepts an options argument to set dateformat, timeformat, timezone and extended.
- `<scheduletimedtask>` now has a `delay=` parameter to coalesce too frequent triggers
