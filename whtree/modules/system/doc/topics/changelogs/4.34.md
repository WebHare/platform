# 4.34 - Current master

## Incompatibilities and deprecations
- WebHare no longer runs install scripts for npm modules downloaded by fixmodules.
- The WebHare V2 Witty APIs (deprecated since V3) have been removed.
- The undocumented `[repeat]` witty statement has been removed.

## Things that are nice to know
- The dialogapi's keyboard capture has been improved to not capture ALL keyboard events (including eg reload) just to prevent
  you from moving focus outside the dialog

## Things you should do
