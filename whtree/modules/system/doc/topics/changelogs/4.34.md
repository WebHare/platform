# 4.34 - Current master

## Incompatibilities and deprecations
- WebHare no longer runs install scripts for npm modules downloaded by fixmodules.
- The WebHare V2 Witty APIs (deprecated since V3) have been removed.
- The undocumented `[repeat]` witty statement has been removed.
- Lists now prefer the colored versions everywhere (icon*s* columns used to prefer the black version where other list icons preferred the color version)
- Modules can no longer be deployed to remote servers from the system:config application - this functionality has moved to the dev module

## Things that are nice to know
- The dialogapi's keyboard capture has been improved to not capture ALL keyboard events (including eg reload) just to prevent
  you from moving focus outside the dialog
- A new Tollium element `<statuspanel>` has been added to wrap showing an info/warning/error at the top of a screen or panel.
- Title field 'seo title' and 'header title' have been added. See [seo-settings.md](https://www.webhare.dev/reference/siteprofiles/seo-settings)
- RunSimpleScreen now supports a `html` option allowing you to pass rich text to dialogs
