# 4.08
## Incompatible changes
- WebHare now requires 'yarn'. If you installed 'yarn' using npm, you should reinstall it using 'brew' as recommended by https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-tab (`npm uninstall -g yarn`)

## Tollium
- The 'magic menu', accessible using Alt+Shift+RightClick, allows you to figure out a components name and inspect list row contents. More options will follow.
  The magic menu is always available on development and test, but enabling it on production requires clicking tollium's black top bar three times. It will flash
  blue to show that the magic menu has been enabled.

## Website and module development
- The Publisher forms api now has some basic support for POSTed forms.
- witty adds 2 more encodings, `:json` and `:jsonvalue`, mapping to `EncodeJSON()` and `EncodeValue(EncodeJSON())` respectively.
- GetAllWebVariables() adds a cell `ispost` to see if a variable was passed through the URL or through the post body.

## WRD
- The WRDType object now exposes UpdateEntity, just like WRDEntity, so you can avoid createing an entity object just to update it
