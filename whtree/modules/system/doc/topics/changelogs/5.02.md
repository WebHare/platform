# 5.2 - current master

PLEASE NOTE! YOU NEED TO UPGRADE TO 4.35 BEFORE UPGRADING TO 5.xx

## Incompatibilities and deprecations
- The standard docker image now only exposes 13684 (the incoming nginx proxy port)
- The 'rescue port' has moved from 13688 to 13679 (where the database port was). Especially with multiple local WebHare
  installations it makes more sense to find the rescueport at the base port number.

- country/nl.whlib has been removed. Replace %SplitNLNrDetail with %SplitHousenumber, %JoinNLNrDetail with %JoinHousenumber and
  %NormalizeNLZipCode with `FixupAddress().zip`
- The old common tidgroups `tollium:common.actions.*`, `tollium:common.labels.*` and `tollium:common.buttons.*` have been deprecated
  and should be replaced with `~` (tilde) common tids.
  - You can use a regex to clean these up: replace `tollium:common\.(actions|labels|buttons)\.` with `~`
- The formbase `wh:form-displaymessage` and `wh:form-validate` events have been removed to be able to improve accessibility

## Things that are nice to know
- All form validation now happens through an explicit validation queue to ensure proper ordering. This may cause validations
  to run on the next tick, requiring you to always use `await test.wait('ui')` in tests if you want to see the result of
  validation in the DOM (earlier it was still recommended but you could often get away with not waiting because some validations
  already happened on focusout instead of waiting until mouseup)
- The `empty` property for browsecustom can now be dynamically changed
- `wrd:entityrefcolumn` adds a `noentityvalue` property which is shown for text columns if no entity is matched
