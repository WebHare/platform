# 5.2 - current master

PLEASE NOTE! YOU NEED TO UPGRADE TO 4.35 BEFORE UPGRADING TO 5.xx

## Incompatibilities and deprecations
- The standard docker image now only exposes 13684 (the incoming nginx proxy port)
- The 'rescue port' has moved from 13688 to 13679 (where the database port was). Especially with multiple local WebHare
  installations it makes more sense to find the rescueport at the base port number.
  installations it make smore sense to find the rescueport at the base port number.
- country/nl.whlib has been removed. Replace %SplitNLNrDetail with %SplitHousenumber, %JoinNLNrDetail with %JoinHousenumber and
  %NormalizeNLZipCode with `FixupAddress().zip`
