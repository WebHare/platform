# 4.30 - Current master

## Incompatibilities and deprecations
- `mod::system/data/wrdschemas/usermgmtschema.xml` has been removed, use `mod::system/data/wrdschemas/usermgmt.wrdschema.xml` instead
- list `selectmode` dynamic changes are now validated and the value must be one of `none`, `single` or `multiple`. Previously any
  unknown value was interpreted as `none`.
- `wh codegrep` and the iconviewer application have been evicted to the `dev` module
- The 'appevents' system (RegisterAppEventListener and BroadcastAppEvent) has been removed. You should use the generic IPC
  broadcast/event listeners APIs or the Tollium `<evenlistener>` component (AppEvents was only a wrapper around these)

## Things that are nice to know
- AWS S3 `GetBucket` now returns common prefixes ('subdirectories')
- AWS S3 `GetDirectory` now also returns subdirectories
- 'Goto URL' in the Publisher will take production URLs of synced sites into accounts to figure out where you want to go
- You can use `<csp policy="frame-ancestors [webhare]" />` to setup the proper rules allowing the current site to be framed
