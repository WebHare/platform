# 4.30 - Current master

## Incompatibilities and deprecations
- `mod::system/data/wrdschemas/usermgmtschema.xml` has been removed, use `mod::system/data/wrdschemas/usermgmt.wrdschema.xml` instead
- list `selectmode` dynamic changes are now validated and the value must be one of `none`, `single` or `multiple`. Previously any
  unknown value was interpreted as `none`.

## Things that are nice to know
- AWS S3 `GetBucket` now returns common prefixes ('subdirectories')
- AWS S3 `GetDirectory` now also returns subdirectories

## Things you should do
