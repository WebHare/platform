# 4.31 - Current master

## Incompatibilities and deprecations
- Various WRDAuth deprecations and removals, contact us if you need any of these APIs:
  - Removes the following APIs from wrdauth: ProcessPasswordReset, ProcessPasswordResetPost, CreateEmailVerificationLink,
    HandleEmailVerificationPage, HandleEmailVerificationData, UpdateUserAccountFields, UpdateUserPassword, GetWRDAuthConfig,
    PrepareMail
  - Removes `wrdauth` from the wrdauth plugin. It will be temporary available as `__GetWRDAuth()` but our intention is to
    completely remove the object 'behind' wrdauth and merge it into the plugin, so don't rely on this one staying around or
    receiving a warning when it finally goes away.

## Things that are nice to know
- `<filetype kind="rawfile">` didn't actually imply 'requirescontent' - documentation updated
- The label on the send button in the standard maildialog can be overridden by passing `sendbuttontitle` to %RunSendEmailDialog
