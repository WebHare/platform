# 4.31 - Current master

## Incompatibilities and deprecations
- Various WRDAuth deprecations and removals, contact us if you need any of these APIs:
  - Removes the following APIs from wrdauth: ProcessPasswordReset, ProcessPasswordResetPost, CreateEmailVerificationLink,
    HandleEmailVerificationPage, HandleEmailVerificationData, UpdateUserAccountFields, UpdateUserPassword, GetWRDAuthConfig,
    PrepareMail
  - Removes `wrdauth` from the wrdauth plugin. It will be temporary available as `__GetWRDAuth()` but our intention is to
    completely remove the object 'behind' wrdauth and merge it into the plugin, so don't rely on this one staying around or
    receiving a warning when it finally goes away.
- JS import `dompack/browersfix/url` is obsolete, the WebHare polyfill already fixes this. You can just remove this import everywhere (at least back to 4.28)

## Things that are nice to know
- `<filetype kind="rawfile">` didn't actually imply 'requirescontent' - documentation updated
- The label on the send button in the standard maildialog can be overridden by passing `sendbuttontitle` to %RunSendEmailDialog
- A new type of schedulde task "Replace with..." allows you to replace the contents of an existing file at a specific time.
- Webtool form hooks can add 'hidden' fields which will be present in the final form results.
- Adds %GetYearlyHoliday to calculate when well known holidays are celebrated
