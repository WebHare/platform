# 4.13
## Incompatible changes
- Siteprofile `<services>` support has been removed. (WCS_, WDS_ en modulebased services will remain)

## Publisher
- Supports recursive `<applysiteprofile />`, and there was much rejoicing.
- The WHFS registry allows to mark 'global' important files and folders. See https://code.webhare.com/core/whfs/api/whfs-register/
- `<addtoassetpack />` allows modules to inject themselves into other asset packs (to help break recursive module dependencies)

## WRD
- Add `->GetDomVals` to the WRDType 2017 version to look up multiple tags. Note that this GetDomVals is not compatible with
  the GetDomVals offered by the legacy WRDType (which has been renamed to ListDomVals)
