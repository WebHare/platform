# 5.1 - current master

PLEASE NOTE! YOU NEED TO UPGRADE TO 4.35 BEFORE UPGRADING TO 5.0 or 5.1

## Incompatibilities and deprecations
- The `needsprofile` attribute is no longer allowed (was already ignored and deprecated, and removed by dev:rewrite)
- The `<wrdauth api2017=` attribute has been dropped. (was already ignored and deprecated, and removed by dev:rewrite)
- Support for MD5 and SHA1 RSA signatures has been dropped
- The `Create_RSA_Hash`, `Verify_RSA_SHA1`, `Create_RSA_SHA1` and `Create_RSA_Hash` APIs have been removed. You should
  use the %MakeCryptoKey API with `Verify` and `Sign`.
- The global `OpenForm` API has been removed. You should always open forms through a webcontext.
- `PrepareForFrontend` is/must now also invoked for non-webtool forms. %OpenWebtoolForm and %OpenFormByTarget have added
  a `prepareforfrontend` option which you can set to FALSE if you don't need frontend preparation.
  - This eliminates a subtle difference between custom and webtool forms but might require you to check for `IsRequest()`
    in PrepareForFrontend.
- Support for WRD Stored queries and the `wrd:queryresults` component has been dropped

## Things that are nice to know
- The `formref` option is now also passed to webtool forms

## Things you should do
