# 4.32 - Current master

## Incompatibilities and deprecations
- We switched from node-sass to dart-sass (as node-sass has been deprecated). Dart-sass is a lot stricter than node-sass
  was so some files (that were already syntactically broken!) may now fail to compile.

## Things that are nice to know
- Forms can now set a `formbacklink` which will be enabled as the previous button on the first page.
- QueueMailInWork has a new option `sensitive`. The contents of these mails are not visible to supervisors in the dashboard
  and sysops are warned when opening these mails.
- WebHare password reset mails are now marked as sensitive.
- `<allowfiletype>` and `<allowfoldertype>` now support a `newonlytemplate` attribute which only allows to select templates
  of that type when creating new files/folders, and not just empty instances)
- Form `<richtext>` can now be created dynamically and have their `richvalue` dynamically updated
