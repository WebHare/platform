# 5.0 - Current master

PLEASE NOTE! YOU NEED TO UPGRADE TO 4.35 BEFORE UPGRADING TO 5.0

## Incompatibilities and deprecations
- The `dbserver` (whdb, WebHareDB) has been removed
- `system.fs_instances.id`, `system.fs_settings.id` and `wrd.entity_settings.id` and any referring columns are now `INTEGER64`s
- Deprecations/removals that a dev:rewrite will fix for you:
  - Support for the `lib=` attribute a `<tolliumcomponent>` has been removed. Merge it into the `objecttype=`
- Support for manually configured scheduler tasks has been removed. You should use `<task>`s in moduledefinitions.
- `<authenticationsettings requireauthorization=false>` has been removed. It wasn't properly parsed from the XML anyway
  and is only acting as the inverse of the `managementmode` property.
- You can no longer manage WRD schema metadata through the legacy objectapi.whlib

## Things that are nice to know
- `<windowopenaction>` now has a `link=` parameter which you can use if the link is hardcoded anyway (no need for a callback)
- The 'Send results by email' form handler will set the Reply-To to the recipient address if not otherwise set
- Dashboard panels can now have individual access checks.
- %TestThrowsLike and %TestRejectedLike now match their exceptions case-insensitively
- The new language construct `FOREVERY [ AWAIT ] (variable YIELD FROM iterator)` has been added, to quickly get
  the values returned by an iterator
- Adds `http://www.webhare.net/xmlns/publisher/widgets/wittyblock` and `http://www.webhare.net/xmlns/publisher/widgets/wittyinline`
  widgets to allow users to directly insert witty objects into RTDs. (Use with care!)
