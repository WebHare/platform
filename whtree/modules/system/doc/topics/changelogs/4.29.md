# 4.29 - Current master

## Incompatibilities and deprecations
- The (partly broken, if the key wast too short) `Encrypt_Blowfish` and `Decrypt_Blowfish` funtions have been removed.
  The algorithm is still accessible through %Encrypt and %Decrypt (if you use algorithm `bf-ecb`) but you should generally avoid ECB in crypto.

## Things that are nice to know
- The testframework added %TTLaunchStartedApp as a clean way to wait for applications to start

## Things you should do
