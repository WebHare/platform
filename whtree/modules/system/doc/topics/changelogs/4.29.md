# 4.29 - Current master

## Incompatibilities and deprecations
- The (partly broken, if the key wast too short) `Encrypt_Blowfish` and `Decrypt_Blowfish` funtions have been removed.
  The algorithm is still accessible through %Encrypt and %Decrypt (if you use algorithm `bf-ecb`) but you should generally avoid ECB in crypto.
- A HareScript Tollium test will now fail if it found missing tids during execution. If you are explicitly testing for missing tids, you should
  clear those tids from `controller->missingtids`.
  clear those tids from `controller->missingtids`.
- The default TLS cipher suite has been updated. If you encounter connection difficulties, this was the previous OpenSSL cipher list:
  `ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:ECDHE-ECDSA-DES-CBC3-SHA:ECDHE-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA:EDH-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA:AES128-GCM-SHA256:AES256-GCM-SHA384:AES128-SHA256:AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:DES-CBC3-SHA:!DSS`
- `<list rowselect>` (ignored since 4.03) will now be deprecated and return warnings/throw if changed
- `<button isdefault>` was already deprecated and will now return warnings if used
- `DumpValue` now prints to stderr (outputid 2) by default (this interferes less with redirection and makes more sense for
  a debugging API). If you tried to capture the output you'll need to explicitly pass `[ outputid := 0 ]` as an option

## Things that are nice to know
- The testframework added %TTLaunchStartedApp as a clean way to wait for applications to start
- QueueMailInWork has an option `ignorerecipientwhitelist` to ignore the email recipient whitelist
- WRD Password resets (including WebHare itself) will ignore the email recipient whitelist
- %Job::GetConsoleExitCode now returns -1 if the job crashed
- `RunScreen` and screen references with a modern namespace (`mod::`, `inline::`, `inline-base64::`) whose filenames end in `.xml`
  can now omit the `#hash` part to reference the first screen in the file (just like WebHare 3 allowed, but less ambiguous)

## Things you should do
- Creating foreign folders in the WebHare Backend site for CI tests is not recommended. Please switch to SetupSiteTestOutput
  for your CI tests (this API has been backported to 4.28.1)
