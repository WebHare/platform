# 4.35 - Current master

## Incompatibilities and deprecations
- Old/legacy consilio APIs have been cleaned up (the search page) or marked as deprcated
- Support for HTTP status texts (the 'Status Reason Phrase', eg the 'Not found' in '404 Not found') has been removed as
  they may cause infoleaks and are only supported in HTTP/1.x anyway.

## Things that are nice to know
- We've added a `@storage-<module>` namespace for JavaScript, which access the storage root for modules (just like `@mod-...`)
  accesses the module root itself. This allows you to add dyanamically generated code to your JS bundles.
- Sites will now postMessage navigation attempts to the webinterface, fixing cross-domain navigation and repeated navigation
  in the Publisher
