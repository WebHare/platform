This directory should be used to store keyfiles and certificates, and enable
SSL support in the WebHare webserver.

Keyfiles and certificates should be stored in the PEM format. Keyfiles should
have a ".key" extension, and certificates should have a matching filename
with a ".crt" extension.

Because your server private key files need to be stored unencrypted, you
should ensure that this directory, and the files within, can only be read
by the WebHare user account.

To create a new key:
openssl genrsa -out newkey.key 2048

To query a key:
openssl rsa -in newkey.key -text

To create a certificate request:
openssl req -key newkey.key -new -out newkey.csr


openssl req -new -key newkey.enc -out newkey.csr

To remove the passphrase afterwards:
openssl rsa -in newkey.enc -out newkey.key

To create a certificate request for an existing key:


The .csr file should be sent to a CA, it will return a .crt file
Or optionally, self-sign it:
openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -sha1 -days 365 -key newkey.key > newkey.crt


IIS pfx files:

If you want to extract private key from a pfx file and write it to PEM file
openssl pkcs12 -in publicAndprivate.pfx -nocerts -out privateKey.pem

If you want to extract the certificate file (the signed public key) from the pfx file
openssl pkcs12 -in publicAndprivate.pfx -clcerts -nokeys -out publicCert.pem
