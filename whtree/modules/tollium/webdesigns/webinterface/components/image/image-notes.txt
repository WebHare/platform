image overlays update:
- overlays will appear correctly without needing to trigger an update after image has loaded
- overlays will resize with the image (for images which use relative sizes such as pr)
- overlays will overlay the (potentially centred) image instead of the whole panel belonging to the image component
- overlays overflowing the area of the <image> component will be clipped
- image “onselect” handler will now actually be called
- added “onchangeoverlays” handler



zit er wel een check op <webdesign assetpack=“..“> of de assetpack wel bestaat?
